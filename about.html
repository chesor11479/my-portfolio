    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate Geospatial Information Scientist with a strong foundation in remote sensing, machine learning, and spatial data analysis. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and innovative thinking to contribute to sustainable development, environmental monitoring, and smart decision-making through geospatial technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I possess strong skills in data analysis, data science, and mathematics, which I apply to geospatial-related projects with expertise in software such as ArcGIS, ERDAS, and QGIS. I am particularly passionate about undertaking projects focused on biomass estimation, forest canopy height analysis, and carbon sequestration. Using advanced remote sensing techniques and tools, I analyze forest ecosystems, leveraging data from LiDAR, Sentinel imagery, and other sources to assess above-ground biomass, monitor vegetation health, and evaluate carbon storage potential.
